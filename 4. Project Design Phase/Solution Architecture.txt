Solution Architecture:
Solution architecture is a complex process – with many sub-processes – that bridges the gap between business problems and technology solutions. Its goals are to:
* Find the best tech solution to solve existing business problems.
* Describe the structure, characteristics, behavior, and other aspects of the software to project stakeholders.
* Define features, development phases, and solution requirements.
* Provide specifications according to which the solution is defined, managed, and delivered.
